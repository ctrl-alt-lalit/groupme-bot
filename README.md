## This program runs chatbots in Groupme. I started this project to learn the GroupMe API, how to use Heroku, and introduce myself to Git.

So far there is just one type of bot which can do the following:
 - greet someone when they first enter a groupchat
 - link a document or website on command
 - mention all the members of a group

This program runs multiple bots concurrently. Each bot is its own object with a unique Flask route.
