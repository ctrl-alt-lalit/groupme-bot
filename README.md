## This program runs chatbots in Groupme. I started this project to learn the GroupMe API, how to use Heroku, and introduce myself to Git.

Each bot can do different things, including:
 - echoing what someone says
 - greeting someone when they first enter a groupchat
 - periodically linking a document
 - mention all the members of a group

This program runs multiple bots concurrently. Each bot is its own object with a unique Flask route.

The number of commits are vastly inflated. The Git has to be updated for every minor change made due to the program being run on the cloud.
